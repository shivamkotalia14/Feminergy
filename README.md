# Feminergy

Feminergy is a healthcare platform created to cater to the female gender, addressing various health issues women may face. It offers online doctors’ appointments, works with online pharmacies, and provides a supportive community called ‘Sakhiya’ where women can exchange experiences and get advice or inspiration.

The platform is centered on menstrual health, encouraging period tracking to avoid cases such as infertility and miscarriage. It also provides a chatbot for immediate support and answers to questions concerning menstrual and reproductive health.

Feminergy aims to destigmatize discussions around menstruation, fight misconceptions, and provide women with a safe platform to manage their health. With AI-based wellness plans, users can track pregnancy, mood, and menstrual cycles. The platform guarantees strong data protection, making it a complete solution provider for women’s healthcare needs.
