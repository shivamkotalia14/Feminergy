          <p className='mental_p'>PMenstruation's effects on mental health can be profound, often manifesting in various emotional and psychological challenges. For many individuals, the premenstrual phase brings about Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), marked by mood swings, irritability, anxiety, or depression. These emotional fluctuations, ranging from mild to severe, can significantly disrupt daily functioning and strain interpersonal relationships. In more severe cases, individuals may contend with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), characterized by intense mood swings, irritability, and debilitating depression and anxiety during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, necessitating medical intervention.

The physical discomfort associated with menstruation, such as cramps, bloating, fatigue, and headaches, can contribute to stress and exacerbate mood disturbances. Coping with these symptoms while balancing daily responsibilities may lead to feelings of frustration, inadequacy, or isolation. Moreover, menstruation can impact body image and self-esteem, particularly if individuals feel self-conscious about physical changes like bloating or weight fluctuations.

          <p className='mental_p'>No studies have been done on anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication for treating 
          people with PCOS specifically, but they may be prescribed in the same way they would be to people without PCOS. 
          Medications that help the body use insulin such as metformin may improve symptoms of depression in people with 
          PCOS. Metformin may also help with anxiety symptoms.<br></br>
          Taking omega-3 fatty acid from fish oil alone, or in combination with Vitamin D, may decrease symptoms of 
          depression and anxiety in people with PCOS.</p>
          <p className='mental_p'>In relationships, mood swings and irritability stemming from PMS or PMDD can strain interactions with partners, family members, or friends, potentially resulting in conflict or misunderstandings. Additionally, for those with a history of trauma, menstruation may trigger emotional distress or traumatic memories, exacerbating existing mental health challenges.

Recognizing the influence of menstruation on mental health is crucial, and seeking support is paramount. Strategies for managing mental health during menstruation may include practicing self-care, seeking therapy or counseling, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and exploring treatment options for menstrual symptoms, such as hormonal birth control or medication for PMDD. Open communication with healthcare providers and loved ones can foster understanding and facilitate effective coping mechanisms, promoting overall emotional well-being.</p>
